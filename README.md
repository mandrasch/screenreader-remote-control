## Background

In last fall I started working as web developer again. Web Accessibility is now part of my daily job, so I needed to learn fast. A big struggle I had at first was operating screenreader software. There are just a lot of keyboard shortcuts to learn while I just wanted to get a basic feeling of how a website is read to screenreader users. Like "Does the screenreader even recognize my button?!".  I'm not sure, but maybe a lot of developers postpone learning a11y skills because of this initial hurdle? 
This project is another attempt to provide a simple learning and test tool for a11y-beginners. 

Disclaimer: I'm an a11y newbie. I try to respect *Nothing About Us Without Us* as much as possible. Feedback is very welcome. :-)
